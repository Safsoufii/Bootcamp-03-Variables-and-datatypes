The first number is: ${myFirstNumber} 
The second number is: ${mySecondNumber}

console.log(`
${myFirstNumber} x ${mySecondNumber} = ${myFirstNumber*mySecondNumber}

The first string is:${myFirstString}.

The second string is:${mySecondString}! 

These two together make: ${myFirstString}. ${mySecondString}!
